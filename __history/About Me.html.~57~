			<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
			<p>I am a recent graduate with a degree in software engineering. I went to California
			Baptist University in Southern California. During my time school, I focused on web
			development. Despite the high number of template creaters, I enjoy building websites
			from scratch. I was also deeply involved with the music department there. I was fortunate 
			to have also landed an internship while at school with a company called Zyante. Zyante does 
			online technical writing for colleges and universities, and I was privilaged to be a part of 
			their development team for two years. I recieved exposure to more web development as well as 
			software testing, bug writing, and new languages in which to program. 
			Some of my passions include building easy-to-use websites, mobile app design, violin, and quality 
			family time. I currently live in Southern California in the Inland Empire.

			<h3>My Background</h3> <br />
			<p>I grew up in the mountains of California as the youngest of six children.
			I initially became interested in engineering when I began looking at Cal 
			Baptist as a possibility for higher education. I started out as an electrical, computer engineer, 
			but switched over as soon as software engineering was available. I have loved
			website development from the moment I was introduced to it, and I have continued to
			enjoy it as I learn more. I have also been extremely involved in music
			and play violin in several orchestras and small groups at school. I have played
			violin for 15 years now.

			<h3>Looking Forward</h3> <br />
			<p>I would like to build a career in web development. My dream would be to have the 
			skills to complete the entire procedure of designing, building, and servicing a 
			website on my own. I still have a lot to learn, and I want to get more involved in 
			other web languages to see what they have to offer.
